    <h1>OSI Model Explained</h1>
    <p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven different layers. Each layer performs specific tasks and interacts with the layers above and below it. The model helps in understanding how different networking protocols and technologies work together to enable communication between devices.</p>
    <h2>The Seven Layers of the OSI Model:</h2>
        <li><strong>Physical Layer:</strong> This layer deals with the physical connection between devices, including cables, switches, and other hardware. It defines how bits are transmitted over the medium.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Link Layer:</strong> Responsible for creating a reliable link between two directly connected nodes. It handles error detection, framing, and flow control.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Layer:</strong> Focuses on routing data packets between different networks. It determines the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport Layer:</strong> Manages end-to-end communication and ensures reliable data transfer. It also handles segmentation, reassembly, and flow control.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Layer:</strong> Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications on different devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation Layer:</strong> Translates data between the application layer and the lower layers. It handles data compression, encryption, and formatting.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Layer:</strong> The topmost layer that directly interacts with user applications. It provides network services to applications, such as email, web browsing, and file transfer.</li>
    <p>By dividing the networking process into these seven layers, the OSI model allows for better understanding, troubleshooting, and development of networking technologies.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>The OSI model provides a structured approach to understanding how communication works in computer networks. It serves as a foundation for networking professionals to design, implement, and maintain complex systems.</p>
